Papye aimes to be a modern, clutter-free and standards-compliant electronic book management utility.

While currently in very early development, papye aims to follow these few basic principles:

* **Modern, clutter-free UI**  
  No longer will there be 100 menus and configuration options between you and your ebooks. Papye is easy to use and makes sense.
* **Transparent metadata management for all major ebook file formats (AZW, EPUB, PDF, MOBI)**  
  Keeps your files pristine by using an internal database, but also allows you to write modified copies of your files for ease of use.
* **First-class comics, manga, magazine, game and scientific paper support**  
  Because every book should be treated the same, we pledge to support every kind of electronic publication, to make your library cleaner and easier to use.
* **Always up-to-date**  
  We use an automated build systems and a standardized contribution guide to provide you with the latest features and fixes as quickly as possible.
* **No bloated features**  
  This is an ebook library management software and it only does one thing: manage ebooks and make them available to your devices. We leave the reading and website-scraping to other specialized utilities.
